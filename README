1. Introduction:

It's a URL shortener written in Scala using the Lift web framework.

2. Roadmap:

* click-through count
* add unique URLs
* preview on mouse-over
* unique visitors count
* access control (at the moment anonymous users can add URLs, but you might
 want to use it in a business environment where only certain roles can add
 URLs)
* Custom Hibernate sequence generator that generates IDs containing alphanumeric
 characters (upper/lower case) because unsigned Long is quite limited.
* clean up code (as I get to grips with Scala)
* etc...
* ZeroClipBoard support:

3. Building

The root POM already points to the location where the Scala tools can be found.
You need to run with Maven with -U the first time around to get the new
plugins.
